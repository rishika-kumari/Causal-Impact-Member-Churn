# Causal Impact of Additional Contributions on Member Churn

This repository investigates the causal and predictive relationship between **additional contributions** in German statutory health insurance funds and the **churn behavior of members**.

## ðŸ“Š Project Objectives

1. **Causal Inference**  
   Estimate the effect of contribution rate increases on member churn using:
   - **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**
   - **Propensity Score Matching (PSM)**

2. **Predictive Modeling**  
   Build a machine learning model (Neural Network) to forecast churn based on fund characteristics.

3. **Comparative Analysis**  
   Compare insights gained from causal vs predictive models to inform decision-making.
